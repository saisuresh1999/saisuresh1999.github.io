## Hi there 👋

I’m **Sai Suresh**, a master’s student in Data Science & AI at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/), Saarbrücken, Germany.  
I’m a **Research Assistant** at the [DFKI – Interactive Machine Learning (IML) Group](https://iml.dfki.de/) and the **Head Tutor** for *Elements of Machine Learning* at Saarland University (instructors: [Prof. Dr. Isabel Valera](https://ivaleram.github.io/) and [Dr. Kavya Gupta](https://kavyagupta.github.io/)).

As a master’s student, my research focuses on **LLM safety and fairness**, **persona / mental modeling and social simulation**, and **financial forensics with generative AI**.  
I’m broadly interested in building evaluations and methods that make model behavior **reliable, transparent, and welfare-oriented**.

I’m currently doing the groundwork for my master’s thesis under the supervision of [**Ruta Binkyte**](https://www.rutabinkyte.com/), [**Ivaxi Sheth**](https://ivaxi0s.github.io/), and [**Hui-Po Wang**](https://hui-po-wang.github.io/), within the [**Trustworthy Machine Learning Group**](https://cispa.de/en/research/groups/fritz) led by [**Prof. Dr. Mario Fritz**](https://cispa.saarland/group/fritz/) at CISPA.

 I’m an active member of the AI Safety Saarland community.

## Research Interests

- **LLM Safety & Fairness:** Studying bias in LLM-generated and LLM-assisted workflows (e.g., academic peer review), examining how subtle institutional and demographic factors shape model behavior and fairness outcomes. 
- **Persona Modeling & Social Simulation:** Extracting personas from long conversations, probing memory and consistency, and using mental models to simulate diverse agent behaviors.  
- **User-Welfare–Centered Safety Evaluation:** Developing context-aware evaluation frameworks for large language models that assess risks and harms relative to individual user profiles, highlighting challenges in measuring safety for vulnerable populations beyond universal-risk settings. 
- **Generative AI for Finance (Financial Forensics):** Post-hoc anomaly explanation and counterfactual journal entries for fraud detection and audit support.
